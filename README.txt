I see that you're using the repository pattern in your project, which is a smart decision because it simplifies how your controllers work. This pattern helps you handle the getting and storing of data. Normally, I like to go with the repository pattern when I need to obtain various kinds of data using different methods. For storing or making changes, I usually prefer the services and actions pattern. However, I can totally grasp the benefits of using repositories, especially in situations like this.

> WHAT MAKES IT AMAZING

1) The way you've used the repository pattern has made your controller super easy to grasp and follow.
2) Using base class for the repository helps us handle common functionalities in a smart way.

> WHAT MAKES IT OK

You're doing a lot of tasks (like fetching data, storing it, and using helper functions) inside the repository class, which can make it seem big. But that's okay. Usually, we split our code like this to make it easier to understand. We use the repository when we want to get data. For storing data, we use a service along with an action class. And if we have small useful functions, we put them in a helper class.

I also noticed that you're even handling things like sending notifications and emails from inside the repository methods. A suggestion I have is to think about putting these actions into a service or a helper. This would make them more usable across the whole project. Personally, I like to use service classes inside helpers. This makes it easier to call functions in a neat way. Another good thing is that if you need to change how the service works later on – let's say you want to switch from using FCM to ONESIGNAL – you'd only have to update the service class inside the helper. This change would automatically affect everything that uses it.

> WHAT MAKES IT TERRIBLE

1) Code Length: Some of your methods have become quite long. It's better to break them into smaller parts for easier understanding.
2) Consistency: I noticed a mix of functionalities. In some parts, you use eloquent, in others, you use the DB directly. Similarly, you initialize and reinitialize the logger in different places.
3) Magic Numbers: Instead of using plain numbers like '2', consider using constants. This makes the code more readable for other developers.
4) Unnecessary Conditions: I noticed there are a lot of if-else conditions in your code, which could make it harder to understand and maintain.
5) Model Methods: You've put methods inside models, which can make them bulky. In the case of using repositories, it's advisable to keep methods there. This is why I usually prefer services and actions in my projects.
6) Response Format: You seem to return different types of responses, like strings and arrays. To make things work well together, it's good to stick to a consistent response format.
7) Code Stability: I noticed that there's no validation in your code to check the incoming data. This missing step could cause problems in terms of reliability and security.
8) Reducing Unnecessary Steps: It might be helpful to use route model binding whenever you can. This can make your code work better and be easier to understand.

> Conclusion
Using the repository pattern boosts controller clarity. Splitting methods and keeping consistent practices can make your code clearer. Having uniform responses helps everything work together smoothly. Your organized code structure using repositories is clear, and refining these points will make your coding skills even better. I have more to share if you're interested.

> CODE REFACTORING
I've improved the controller class to make it clearer, but diving deep into the repository's business logic may take a while due to the controller's complexity. I haven't addressed the tests yet, as they're interconnected and time-intensive. If you'd like me to proceed, please inform me.
